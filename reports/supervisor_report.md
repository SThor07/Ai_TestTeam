### Prompt Improvements

The current prompt is quite specific and focused on searching for upcoming flight details. However, there are some opportunities to improve the prompt to make it more flexible and robust.

* Consider adding modalities to handle different types of responses (e.g., "What's my flight status?", "Can you show me my itinerary?", etc.)
* Add a hint or context about what kind of information is expected in the response (e.g., "Please provide the flight details, including departure and arrival times")

### Plan Flaws

The current plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some potential issues that could arise:

* The plan assumes that the search bar will be populated with flight-related emails. However, this might not always be the case (e.g., if the user has no relevant emails). Consider adding a subgoal to handle this scenario.
* The plan does not explicitly check for the presence of upcoming flights in the results. This could lead to incorrect conclusions if there are no upcoming flights found.

### Coverage Expansion

To improve the robustness and coverage of the plan, consider the following:

* Add a subgoal to handle the case where no flight-related emails are found (e.g., "Search for alternative ways to find flight details")
* Consider adding more specific steps to filter results by date or other relevant criteria
* Expand the scope of the search to include other possible sources of flight information (e.g., online travel agencies, flight status websites)

By addressing these areas, you can improve the overall robustness and effectiveness of your planner.
